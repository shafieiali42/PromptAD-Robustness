# PromptAD Robustness Evaluation

## Overview  
This repository extends the **PromptAD** method, which leverages **prompt tuning** to adapt **vision-language models (VLMs)** for **few-shot anomaly detection**.  

In this work, we evaluate the **robustness** of PromptAD by testing its performance under various **image corruptions**. Our analysis provides insights into the methodâ€™s **stability** and **reliability** in real-world scenarios where data quality may be degraded.
